## ☕ Coffee Break

Imagine leaving your PC for a while to grab some coffee — but you can’t let it sleep or lock, because someone might mess with your work. I’ve seen people leave a paper note on their screen saying “Don’t touch!” — so I made a lightweight digital version.

This app lets you:

* Write a custom message
* Choose a screen color (red, black, yellow, green)
* Set a 6-digit PIN
* Lock the screen with a fullscreen banner showing your message
* Unlock by pressing **Shift** → enter your PIN

It’s not packed as an `.exe` yet — just uploading the code for now.

⚠️ It has some bugs and might misbehave a bit (dedly 🧨) — but meh.
